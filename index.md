I am Cal State Fullerton student, majoring in computer science and I plan to gradaute in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, Part 1

I enjoyed this lab because I was able to write a clear message on my computer about what computers can do and what they can not do.


* Lab 8

I was able to better understand the game of poker and translate this knowledge that I had into my code. This would lead me to make as much money as I can while programming as well.


 * Lab 12

We were able to program the estimate of a judge scoring card and I found it interesting viewing the different numbers that were being shown up as most of the numbers would be small and some would be big.
